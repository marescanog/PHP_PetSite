  'Paragraph1' => 'After a miscarriage, we felt empty. It seemed that there was nothing to look forward to after the work day since we were going back to an empty house. The days go by as though in a blur and an endless marathon of emptiness. A friend of mine suggested to get a dog and said that Cebu Pet Match has a variety of dogs that we can choose from and get the right dog for us.',
  'Paragraph2' => 'We thought that this might be a good idea and we decided to give it a try. Although a dog could never
replace a child, a dog might be something that can fill the emptiness that we are feeling. Caring for a
dog would bring the emotional healing that we need.',
  'Head2' => '"We would go for long walks in the park. Spending time together with sparky has kept Roger and I closer"',
  'Paragraph3' => 'Since Sparky came into our lives, we felt renewed and more alive. Now with the pandemic we are both
working from home and Sparky moves back and forth between our work stations. At the end of the
workday, Sparky would bring her toys to us and would want to play. We have been getting more
exercise since Sparky came into our lives.',
  'Paragraph4' => 'Sparky was staring at the door when we came through and she wagged her tail at us. I could feel the
acceptance and love from Sparky the moment she saw us and we knew that this was the dog for us.
Since Sparky came into our lives, we feel like we have something to look forward to at the end of the
work day again and Sparky also shares that same feeling. Thank you Cebu Pet Match for bringing Sparky
to us.',

  'Paragraph5' => 'Sparky was posted up for adoption on Cebu Pet Match since the original owner had passed away. Sparky ended up in foster care since there were no descendants left to care for her. Melinda and Roger found Sparky on Cebu Pet Match and submitted an inquiry. They visited the foster shelter and felt they had a "connection" with sparky. Melinda and Roger felt a "spark" between them and Sparky and thus she received the name. They have all been happily living together as a family ever since 2019.',
