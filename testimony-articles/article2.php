sister it would be ok if they will never give me any more gifts for my birthday or gifts for Christmas. But
no baby brother or baby sister ever appeared and I got to be so sad and lonely.',
  'Paragraph2' => 'My parents did not want me to be lonely so they took me to Cebu Pet Match to find a pet for me. Finally
we were at Cebu Pet Match. I was feeling excited at seeing all the animals and I wondered if I would
find the right one for me.',

  'Paragraph3' => 'I now have a partner in everything and I am not lonely anymore. I can talk to Butter about anything and
Butter will always listen. He waits for me at the door until I come home from school and then we play in
the yard. Butter likes to play fetch but at times he would tease me by not giving me the ball right away. It
is all in good fun.',
  'Paragraph4' => 'Butter was running around and playing with other dogs when I saw her. Butter ran to me and started
playing with me and I know that this is the dog for me. Butter is with me everywhere I go. We eat
together, play together, sleep together. Butter is like the little baby brother to me and is family.',

  'Paragraph5' => 'Butter came from a litter of 1. The birth came unexpected since Butter\'s mother was a very old dog. Although he was the only puppy in the litter, the former owner could not take care of butter due to the owner\'s old age. Butter was always energetic and the former owner could not keep up. Butter was placed up for adoption on Cebu Pet Match and eventually Nathan\'s family found him. Nathan and Butter had the same energetic and playful energy and they became bestfriends ever since. ',
